## 1. OPENING HOOK (Why We Exist)

### Headline
**More Than Just Landscaping — It's Personal**

### Opening Paragraph
We started Evergrow Landscaping in 2023 because we were tired of seeing homeowners get burned by unreliable contractors who didn't show up, didn't communicate, and didn't care. We've built our business on a simple promise: do what we say we'll do, treat your property with respect, and be there when you need us. That's not just good business—it's how we'd want to be treated, and it's what keeps our customers coming back season after season.

## 2. THE PROBLEM WE SAW IN THE MARKET

### Section Heading
**Why We Started Evergrow**

### Content
**[NEED: Founder name - using "Karson" as placeholder]**

When Karson started Evergrow in 2023, he kept hearing the same frustrations from homeowners: landscapers who didn't show up when promised, crews who left properties messy, companies that added surprise charges, and worst of all—contractors who simply stopped answering the phone after getting paid.

Homeowners were spending their weekends trying to keep up with yard work because they couldn't find someone reliable. When they did hire help, they'd get burned by poor communication, inconsistent quality, or flat-out no-shows. It was an industry where "good enough" seemed to be the standard, and customers had learned to expect disappointment.

Karson saw an opportunity to build something different—a landscaping company where reliability wasn't a bonus, it was the foundation. Where clear communication wasn't an afterthought, it was part of the service. Where quality work wasn't luck, it was guaranteed. That vision became Evergrow Landscaping, and it's guided every decision we've made since.

## 3. OUR APPROACH/SOLUTION

### Section Heading
**How We're Different**

### Content
We built Evergreen on four principles that still guide us today: craftsmanship, putting customers first, genuine passion for the work, and unwavering professionalism.

Here's what that actually means in practice: When we say we'll be there Tuesday at 9am, we're there Tuesday at 9am. When we give you a quote, that's the price—no hidden fees, no surprise add-ons. When we finish a job, your property looks better than when we arrived, and we've cleaned up completely. And when you call or text with a question or concern, we respond within 24 hours. Every time.

We're not trying to be the biggest landscaping company in Oklahoma. We're trying to be the one you trust, the one you recommend to your neighbors, the one you call year after year because you know exactly what you're going to get. Quality over volume. Relationships over transactions. That's the Evergrow difference, and it's why we're committed to this mission.

## 4. TEAM/FOUNDER STORY

### Section Heading
**Meet the Team**

### Founder Profile - Karson
**[NEED: Full founder details - name, background, personal story, how they got into landscaping, family involvement]**

**Placeholder Version 1 (More Personal):**
Karson started Evergreen Landscaping over 20 years ago with a simple mission: provide reliable, quality landscaping service that homeowners could count on. Growing up in Oklahoma, he learned the value of hard work and keeping your word—lessons that became the foundation of Evergreen.

What started as a one-person operation with a truck and a mower has grown into a trusted team serving El Dorado and Oklahoma City. But the mission hasn't changed: show up when you say you will, do excellent work, and treat every property like it's your own.

**Placeholder Version 2 (More Business-Focused):**
Growing Evergrow Landscaping from a simple mission to provide reliable, communicative, quality service that homeowners could actually depend on. His deep knowledge of Oklahoma's unique climate and growing conditions, combined with a commitment to customer satisfaction, has made Evergrow the go-to choice for homeowners who are tired of being let down by unreliable contractors.

### Our Team Philosophy
Every member of our crew is background-checked before they ever step foot on your property. But we don't just hire for landscaping skills—we hire people who take pride in their work, who understand that your home is your biggest investment, and who know how to communicate respectfully with customers.

Our team members are trained not just in proper mowing techniques or plant care, but in how to respect your property, how to answer your questions, and how to leave your yard looking better than they found it. Because at the end of the day, our reputation is built on every single interaction, every lawn we mow, every bed we plant.

## 5. VALUES THAT GUIDE US

### Section Heading
**Our Commitment to You**

### The Four Core Values

#### CRAFTSMANSHIP
We don't cut corners. Every lawn, every flower bed, every project receives the same attention to detail we'd want for our own homes. Whether it's a weekly mowing or a complete landscape installation, we approach each job with the same commitment to quality. Your property deserves our best work, and that's exactly what you'll get.

#### CUSTOMER-CENTRIC
Your satisfaction isn't just important—it's everything. We listen to your needs, communicate every step of the way, and make adjustments until you're completely happy. Have a concern? We want to hear it. Not satisfied with something? We'll make it right. Your peace of mind is part of the service we provide.

#### PASSION
We genuinely love what we do. There's something deeply satisfying about transforming an overgrown yard into a beautiful outdoor space, about seeing the pride on a homeowner's face when they pull into their driveway. That passion drives us to keep improving, keep learning, and keep delivering results that make our customers smile.

#### PROFESSIONALISM
Licensed, insured, and accountable—those aren't just checkboxes for us, they're commitments to you. We show up on time, do the job right the first time, and respect your property like it's our own. When we say we'll be there, we're there. When we give you a price, that's the price. When we make a promise, we keep it. That's professionalism, and it's non-negotiable.
