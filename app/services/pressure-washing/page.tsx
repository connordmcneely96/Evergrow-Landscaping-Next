  {
    question: 'How much does pressure washing cost?',

    question: 'How often should I pressure wash?',
    answer: 'We recommend annual pressure washing for most surfaces to prevent buildup of mold, mildew, and algae. High-traffic areas like driveways may benefit from twice-yearly cleaning.',

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Oklahoma's humidity creates the perfect environment for mold, mildew, and algae. Over time, your once-bright driveway turns green, your deck gets slippery, and your home's siding loses its luster.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
                You might think about renting a pressure washer from the hardware store. But here's the thing: too much pressure can etch concrete, splinter wood, and damage siding. Too little pressure won't actually clean anything.
